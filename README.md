# odin-recipes
Odin's practise project

In this project, i will create a simple website which have several pages includes some basic cooking recipe. I use basic HTML element such as <h1>, <p>, <a>, <img>, <ul>, and <ol>. In the future, I will come back to this project to add some CSS styles to make it look nice and organized.
